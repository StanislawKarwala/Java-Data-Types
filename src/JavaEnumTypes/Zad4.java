/*
Write a Java program to implement an enum called "Direction" with constants representing the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).

Explanation:
The above program implements an enum called Direction with four values representing the cardinal directions:
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST. Inside the main method, we create two variables, direction1 and direction2,
both of type Direction, and assign them the values NORTH and WEST.
Finally, we print the values of direction1 and direction2 using System.out.println().

Sample Output:
First direction: NORTH
Second direction: WEST
*/

public class Zad4 {
    public enum Direction{
        NORTH,
        SOUTH,
        EAST,
        WEST
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
